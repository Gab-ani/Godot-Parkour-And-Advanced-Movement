This is the second episode for the series.
Originally I planned to review the movement techniques that were already implemented in the first branch.
However the code for those wasn't my brightest creation, I wanted to refactor it, and during that refactoring the question of better edge detection was lifted.
Trying to create a better algorithm to search for 3d edges lead me to be a tiny lil bit mad about physical simulation solutions.
So I ended up creating a nuclear solution to find every single climbable edge in observable universe.
To do this we actually use geometry of level objects instead of physical simulations.
